Dependencies:
Weather APIs
React App
Firebase

Tasks for project completion:
Setup create-react-app scaffold
Establish connection with Weather API
Call the Weather API with user inputted location (that can change)
Store API fetch in React component state
Render React state
Clean up code
Deploy web server

Plan:
Create create-react-app scaffold
Structure page based on wireframe or final desired state
Create input field and button that will call API with input text and clear the input field onClick
Deploy the server (iterate / update as needed)
Develop API connection
Develop passing a user assigned value request to the API
Generate relevant page content with API return data
