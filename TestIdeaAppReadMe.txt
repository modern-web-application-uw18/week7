MVP is just return test ideas, put them into a list, and users can print the page from their browser.

The categories are part 2.

Dependencies are React, PropTypes, React-Router-Dom, Firebase, NPM (of course), 2 Google web fonts, google OAUTH for signing in to save the info if I get that far, and possibly a module for saving as text and image formats if I'm able to get those parts going.

Tasks 1 to 12 are MVP tasks to do first:
1.	 Plan data structure.
2.	Finish wireframing.
3.	Create logo.
4.	Finalize icons.
5.	Create custom buttons.
6.	Import Google Fonts.
7.	Import and initialize Firebase in my app. Done with step 7, working on Step 8 on Monday June 11th
8.	Add test ideas into Firebase database.
9.	Create CSS and layout cards.
10.	Mockup App.js and home page.
11.	Home page CSS.
12.	Return random test idea from all categories.
13.	Hook up Test Inventory Data to build return items from Firebase.
14.	Return test idea from one category (Radio button style).
15.	Return test ideas from multiple categories (Checkboxes) in order of categories. 
16.	Hook up buttons to remove saved ideas from Test Idea Inventory.
17.	Hook up the up and down buttons to reorder test idea categories.
18.	Hook up code to show correct buttons (Only show down/up if it makes sense).
19.	Expand/Collapse code for each category.
20.	Reset button for Test Idea Inventory so anyone can start over.
21.	Allow Export  and Print by turning off the -+ buttons and making a list with simple headers and checkboxes. (Text? Image? PDF? Print? Need to research how difficult this is)
22.	Allow users to add their own ideas to the list and save them in the session.
23.	Allow users to submit test ideas to the database (Curated. This might be too risky for abuse potential).
24.	Add Contact info and about data somewhere.
