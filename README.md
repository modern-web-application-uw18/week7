# Week 7 Assignment

Name: Serenity News

Elevator pitch: Sick of seeing Trump in the headlines? Wish your news was sports-free? Now you have the ability to only get the news you want! With Serenity News, you specify the words you don't want to see, and it will hide the articles that had those words in their title or description. 

Wireframe: See FinalProjectWireframe.png. 

Dependencies: npm modules, a news API (probably Reuters)

A list of tasks that need to be completed for my project:
* Setup `create-react-app` scaffold
* Enter a keyword(s) to be filtered out
* Call the news API and get data
* Store API results in React component state if keyword is not in title or description
* Render React state

A plan for the next 3 weeks and what I plan to accomplish each week:
* Week 1: Find a good API
* Week 2: Make all the GUI
* Week 3: Get the filtering to work
