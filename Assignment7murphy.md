# Week 7 Assignment
The main goal from this course was to create something that I can use. The one thing that my wife and I could use is a Checklist/Grocery list Application that can store multiple lists. 
The app should allow the user to create a list, add items, remove items and check off if a item is completed. This will be useful not just for shopping, but as a to do list kind of like the one done in class. 

## Working Title:
Get It / Do It

## Tasks needed to complete project (some are already complete)
* Set up create-react-app scaffold
* Create components for:
    * List
    * List Items
    * Form
* Set up Firebase to store list information
* Refine layout
* CSS for List items
* Deploy on Firebase

## Nice to haves
Any kind of graphics. Im not entirely sure how I would implement them since information is going to be fluid. 
I looked for a quality Grocery App to use to populate lists with 
product information. The page for Supermarket API left me with a 500 server error. That seemed to be the most reputable one. There were no decent APIs to incorporate for the stores that we frequent the most. 

## Dependencies
* Firebase (For db and deployment reasons), React react-dom, react-router-dom

## End thoughts
Hopefully this will replace our current list method of scraps of paper and additional items sent over text. :)
