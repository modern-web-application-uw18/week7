* The name of your project
  - Hover Flashcards


* An elevator pitch
  - I have always wanted to design my own flashcard app when learning vocabulary, making it as easy as to just hovering on the card to flip to the back. Also, I'm thinking of adding difficulty levels where the card would flip once and flip back to its front side in seconds. I'll adjust the amount of seconds we get to see the back side (answer). I could even hide parts of the answer so it'll seem like a quiz!


* Wireframe
  - https://wireframe.cc/Iz434D


* A list of dependencies you'll be using for your project (npm modules, APIs, Firebase, etc.)
  - React, Bootstrap, Firebase, jQuery


* A list of tasks that need to be completed for your project
  - Setup React App
  - Setup Firebase and create JSON with custom data for the flashcards
  - Store and pull data using React
  - Render React state


* A plan for the next 3 weeks and what you plan to accomplish each week
  - 1 week: Setup the backbone of the React App and setup Firebase
  - 2 week: Create JSON data and implement code
  - 3 week: Integrate features using jQuery and use CSS to polish design
