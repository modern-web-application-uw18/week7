# Contractors Project Data Management

### Elevator Pitch

This app is intended for the use of independent contractors who need to manage a lot of daily line item data per job.

Currently many small contractors manually manage a lot of daily job specific data. This means emails, texts, some handwritten records and paper receipts. The value that this app can provide is making it easier for management to define the scope of the job and the employees and empower the employees to enter the job data using an easily accessible web app on their phone or tablet.
