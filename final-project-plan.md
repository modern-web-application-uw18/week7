# Final Project Plan

## Project Name: 

Convert & Go

## Elevator Pitch:

Our app is a currency converter that will allow the user to convert US dollars to a currency of their choosing. It will use an API to load live currency exchange rate data.

## Who will use it:

Our target user is a person who is or will be traveling internationally. 

## Value to the end user:

This app will be valuable for the traveler that needs a quick way to check what the current currency exchange rate of a particular currency is with the US dollar.

## Wireframes: 

See attached PDF.

## Dependencies: 

* npm modules: Prop-types, others TBD 
* API: TBD currency exchange api
* GH Pages (deployment)

## Task List:

* Create wireframes and design direction 
* Set-up 'create react app' scaffold
* Research and pick a good currency exchange rate API
* Call the currency API and print results
* Store API results in React component state
* Render React state
* Gather an images or icons needed for app design
* Use CSS to style UI elements
* User-test with friends and family
* adjust design as needed based on testing

## Plan/schedule: 

This will be a team-project (Bre & Allisa LeBeuf). We will split the tasks up between us in order to accomplish them in a timely manner.

## Nice-to-haves:

* convert any currency to any currency (not limited to US dollar)
