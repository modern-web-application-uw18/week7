# Week 7 Assignment
## Project name
Jeff's Weather App

## Details
This app will allow its user to look up the weather for any requested location. Additional functionalities include allowing the user to search by city and state or by zip code. It will display the current weather for that location as well as a variety of other information. I also plan to add the option to toggle between Celcius and Fahrenhiet temps.

## Dependencies
- [React.js](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/)
- [npm node-modules](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-modules)


## Task List
* Setup `create-react-app` scaffold
* Create components
* Render components
* Obtain API key from a weather site and incorporate it into the app.
* Add Bootstrap and CSS to enhance UI

## Plan Timeline
- Week 1: planning and initial components setup
- Week 2: coding components, functionality check, API setup
- Week 3: add visual improvements to UI, let family/friends/coworkers test out
