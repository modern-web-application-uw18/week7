Project name:
kathrynlovestravis.com

Elevator pitch:
A website for our wedding next year. The website will be a single page site.  
There will be different components for each part of the site, including: about us,
the wedding, accomodations, registry, and a guest book as a like to have. 
Since the application is a single page application the navigation bar will use 
react-scroll to autofocus on the page components. Page content will be stored in
a json file.

Wireframes:
