1.	Project Name: Self checkout library application
2.	An elevator pitch: This app will allow a user to self checkout books from a library without any manual help, thereby reducing unnecessary wait times and easier online account access.
3.	List of dependencies: a) react, b) npm b) create mock API taht returns a list of books that the library holds
4.	List of tasks that need to be completed: 
    a) create-react-app
    b) create mock API that returns a list of books
    c) create components to fetch books using above API and incorporate checkout logic
    d) implement wireframes
5.	Plan for the next weeks
       week1: create mock API and hook it up with react component
       week2: implement library logic, website deployment and final fit and finish
